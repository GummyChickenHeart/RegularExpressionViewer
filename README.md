# RegularExpressionViewer (for C#)

## Motivation
I'm motivated by [Regexper](https://regexper.com/), but it is not for C#. 

I want to make a similar one which can deal with extensions, such as Named capture.

[Rex](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52296), created by Microsoft Research Team, is a very good tool and has very interesting theoretical ideas, but it does not focus on extensions, too.
If need, discussion for theoretical analysis of Regular Expressions on this repository is also welcome.
